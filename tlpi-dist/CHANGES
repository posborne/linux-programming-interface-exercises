This file summarizes the changes that have been made since publication
to the program examples printed in "The Linux Programming Interface".
Background on some of these changes can be found in the online errata
for TLPI, available at http://man7.org/tlpi/errata/.

2010-11-13
        sockets/us_abstract_bind.c
                The code was improved as per the errata for page 1176.

2011-01-17
        timers/real_timer.c
                A mistake in the ordering of the code in main() was fixed.
                See the erratum for page 483.

2011-02-17
        psem/thread_incr_psem.c
                Fixed an error in a comment. See the erratum for page 1102.

2011-04-05
        threads/thread_multijoin.c.
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_no_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.

2011-04-19
        altio/demo_sigio.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 1349.
        daemons/daemon_SIGHUP.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 774.

2011-05-18
        signals/t_kill.c
                Fixed an error in a diagnostic message. See the erratum
                for page 406.

2011-07-06
        Makefile
                Added missing "memalloc" to the directory list.
        memalloc/free_and_sbrk.c
                Added feature test macro definition (_BSD_SOURCE).
                See the erratum for page 142.

2011-08-11
        acl/acl_view.c
                Fixed a small bug as per the erratum for page 336.

2011-09-04
        pipes/popen_glob.c
        procexec/make_zombie.c
        sockets/inet_sockets.c
                Removed an unnecessary assignment statement that added
                a terminating null byte to the string buffer output by
                snprintf().  See the erratum for page 555.

2011-12-05
        dirs_links/t_unlink.c
                Added a comment referring to the erratum for page 348.

2011-12-06
        pty/unbuffer.c
                Change parent exit status when read() returns <= 0
                from EXIT_FAILURE to EXIT_SUCCESS.

2011-12-13
        signals/catch_rtsigs.c
                Restore 3 lines that were accidentally omitted at the
                end of this program. See the erratum for page 463.

2011-12-31
        threads/thread_incr.c
                Make global variable 'glob' volatile, so that the program
                more easily produces "incorrect" behavior, even in the face
                of compiler optimizations. See the erratum for page 632.

2012-02-16
        lib/alt_functions.c
                Fix indentation in ALT_posix_openpt().

2012-04-03
        lib/Makefile
        lib/Build_ename.sh
                Refactor, so that Build_ename.sh produces output on stdout,
                rather than to a named file.

2012-04-06
        lib/itimerspec_from_str.c
                Conditionally make the content of this file empty if
                compiling on MacOSX, since that operating system doesn't
		define the 'itimerspec' structure.
		(Only in "dist" version of code.)
        Makefile.inc.MacOSX
                Remove '-lrt' from the IMPL_LDLIBS definition, since there
                is no librt on MacOSX.
