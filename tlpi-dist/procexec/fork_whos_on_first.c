/* fork_whos_on_first.c

   Parent repeatedly creates a child, and then processes both race to be the
   first to print a message. (Each child terminates after printing its message.)
   The results of running this program give us an idea of which of the two
   processes--parent or child--is usually scheduled first after a fork().

   Whether the child or the parent is scheduled first after fork() has
   changed a number of times across different kernel versions.
