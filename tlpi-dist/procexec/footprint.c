/* footprint.c

   Using fork() + wait() to control the memory footprint of an application.

   This program contains a function that (artificially) consumes a large
   amount of memory. To avoid changing the process's memory footprint, the
   program creates a child process that calls the function. When the child
   terminates, all of its memory is freed, and the memory consumption of
   the parent is left unaffected.
