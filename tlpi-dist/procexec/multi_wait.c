/* multi_wait.c

   Demonstrate the use of wait(2): create multiple children and then wait
   for them all.

   Usage: multi_wait sleep-time...

   One child process is created for each command-line argument. Each child
   sleeps for the number of seconds specified in the corresponding command-line
   argument before exiting. After all children have been created, the parent
   loops, waiting for terminated children, and displaying their PIDs.
