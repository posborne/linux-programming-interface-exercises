/* signal.c

   An implementation of signal() using sigaction().

   Compiling with "-DOLD_SIGS" provides the older, unreliable signal handler
   semantics (which are still the default on some System V derivatives).
*/
/* Some UNIX implementations follow the BSD signal() semantics, including
   Linux, Tru64, and of course the BSD derivatives. Others, such as Solaris,
   follow the System V semantics. We'll conditionally override signal() on
   platforms following the System V semantics. For the other implementations,
   we'll provide a dummy source file that doesn't implement signal().
