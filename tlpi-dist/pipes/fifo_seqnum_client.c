/* fifo_seqnum_client.c

   A simple client that uses a well-known FIFO to request a (trivial)
   "sequence number service". This client creates its own FIFO (using a
   convention agreed upon by client and server) which is used to receive a reply
   from the server. The client then sends a request to the server consisting of
   its PID and the length of the sequence it wishes to be allocated. The client
   then reads the server's response and displays it on stdout.

   See fifo_seqnum.h for the format of request and response messages.

   The server is in fifo_seqnum_server.c.
