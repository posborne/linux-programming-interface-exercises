/* orphaned_pgrp_SIGHUP.c

   Usage: orphaned_pgrp_SIGHUP {s|p} ...

        (e.g.: orphaned_pgrp_SIGHUP s p p)

   Creates an orphaned process group containing one process for each
   command-line argument. If the command-line argument corresponding to this
   child is 's', then the child stops itself by raising SIGSTOP.  If the
   command-line argument is 'p' then the child does a pause().

   This program can be used to show that when a process group that contains
   stopped children becomes orphaned, then all members of the process group are
   sent a SIGHUP signal, to inform them that they have been disconnected from
   their session, followed by a SIGCONT signal, to ensure that they resume
   execution. Try running the following commands and observing the difference
   in output:

        orphaned_pgrp_SIGHUP s p
        orphaned_pgrp_SIGHUP p p
