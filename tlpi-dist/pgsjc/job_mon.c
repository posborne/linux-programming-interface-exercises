/* job_mon.c

   This program is useful for:

      - demonstrating the order in which the shell creates the processes in a
        pipeline and how it assigns a process group to these processes, and

      - monitoring some of the job control signals sent to a process (group).

   The program displays its PID, parent PID and process group.

   Try running a pipeline consisting of a series of these commands:

        job_mon | job_mon | job_mon

   This will demonstrate the assignment of process groups and PIDs to
   each process in the pipeline.

   Try running this pipeline under different shells and also in the background
   (pipeline &) to see the effect this has.

   You can also try typing control-C (^C) to demonstrate that this is
   interpreted by the terminal driver as meaning "send a signal to all the jobs
   in the foreground process group".
