/*
 * The tee command reads its standar input until end-of-file, writing a
 * copy of the input to standard output and to the file named in its
 * command-line argument.  (We show an example of the use of this command
 * hwne we discuss FIFOs in Section 44.7.)  Implement tee using I/O
 * system calls.  By default, tee overwites any existing file with the
 * given name.  Impelment the -a command-line option (tee -a file), which
 * casuses te to append text to the end of a file  if it already exists.
 * (Refer to Appendix B for desription ofthe getopt() function, which can
 * be used to parse command-line options.)
